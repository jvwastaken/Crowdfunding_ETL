# Crowdfunding_ETL

## Code Sources:
- Module 9 was used as reference for creating the [crowdfunding_db schema](Resources/crowdfunding_db_schema.sql) in PostgreSQL.

- For the [Main File](ETL_Mini_Project_SWeeks_JViloria.ipynb):
    - Module 13: Days 1 & 2 were used as reference for creating the regex patterns (`p`) to be used in `str.extract(p)`.
    - Previous materials covered in class were used when using `pd` commands.

-[QuickDBD](https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/) was used to create the [ERD](Resources/ERD_sketch.png).

-XPert Learning Assistant was used to review and double check our code as needed.

>[!NOTE]
>In the [Main File](ETL_Mini_Project_SWeeks_JViloria.ipynb), we used Option 2: Using regex in order to create the contacts dataframe.
